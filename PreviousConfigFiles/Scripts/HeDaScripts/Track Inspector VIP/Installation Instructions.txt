---------------------------------------------------

* Requirements

* Installation

  After installing it from HeDaScripts Manager, make sure you install SWS and
  js_ReaScriptAPI too.

  Install the VST3 version of dpMeter 4.3.11. if you want Loudness meter
  support. Uncheck the VST2 version at installation to avoid using the VST2
  version.

  You can search now in actions list for HeDa Track Inspector and you cna run
  the main action: "Script: HeDa_Track Inspector VIP.lua"
  
  You can create a toolbar button or assign it a keyboard shortcut.
	
  There is an additional lua file that starts the script in master mode by
  default showing the master track. "Script: HeDa_Track Inspector
  VIP_Master.lua"




* How to start Track Inspector or any script every time you start REAPER?

  In REAPER there is a special script that is run every time if the script
  exists. The file is "__startup.lua" located in the Scripts folder in your
  REAPER resources folder.

  If you don't have this file, it is normal. You can create it by going to the
  Actions window, and click in the New... button next to the Reascript: text.

  It prompts you for the file name. Enter __startup.lua (notice there is a
  double _ )and then you will be presented with a script editor. Here you have
  to enter the code to call other scripts.

  Enter this line to start Track Inspector VIP for example:

    reaper.Main_OnCommand(reaper.NamedCommandLookup("_RSe3ad1140dc733c3ccfe65a67ec53bfc634535821"), -1) --Run Track Inspector VIP

  you can enter new lines for each script you want to auto start. The
  _RSe3ad1140dc733c3ccfe65a67ec53bfc634535821 in this example is the command ID
  for Track Inspector VIP. To find other IDs for other scripts you must find them
  in your actions list selecting the action for the script and right click and
  Copy command ID. then you cna paste it in your script editor.

  Now you only have to Save the script. (CTRL+S) and that's it. Try to test it
  by restarting REAPER and the Track Inspector VIP should be started
  automatically. It remembers the docker posiiton. If the first time appears in
  a different docker, just move it to where you want it and next time it will be
  there.




* Terminating the script:

  With the script running, running again the action will ask what do you want to
  do. Terminate and close it. Or run another instance. You have to enable "remember my answer for this script"
  and click "Terminate instances"
