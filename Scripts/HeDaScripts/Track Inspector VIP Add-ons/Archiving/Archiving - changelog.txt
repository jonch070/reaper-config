* v0.1.0 (2023-05-29)
  + Archive. Archives the tracks inside the RPP file. Just mutes, hides the track and sets the FXChain to offline.
  + Archive to External. Arhives track and removes FXChain saving it to a file in project's subfolder
  + Archive to Global. Arhives track and removes FXChain saving it to a folder inside scripts configuration which is the same for all projects. Good for using with project templates where the tracks have always the same IDs.
  + Panel menu setting: Hide tracks when archiving
  + Panel menu setting: Locks tracks when archiving
  + Panel menu setting: Ask to overwrite Global files. By default it doesn't overwrite the global files if you are archiving a track that already has a global file saved previously. If you want to update the template, you can enable this and say yes to overwrite when archiving the track.
