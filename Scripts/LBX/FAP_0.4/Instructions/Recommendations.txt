Melda Production Plugins - Need turn on "Automation compatibility mode for v10" in plugin settings
ReaDelay - Need add second tape to default preset
ReaEQ - Make in default preset Low Cut - Band 1, High Cut - Band 6
JS - Some plugins parameters can be fully controlled only in native shell
JS - Some JS compressors have reduction meter

At this moment need to do "2" and "3" in "Step 6" every time, when you open new project from template
