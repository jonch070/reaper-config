2.5.9

[Progression / Timing]
+ New "Tight Timing" option (Right-Click the PLAY button): progression playback moves out of the defer loop into a JSFX that emits the notes from the audio thread, on the exact sample. The old path picked the start of a chord with roughly 33 ms of slack and then went through StuffMIDIMessage, which waits for the next audio block on top of that - at 120 BPM that is over 6% of a beat, which is what made the progression feel loose against the grid.
+ Strum and arpeggio no longer stall REAPER. They used to busy-wait on the main thread between notes (five notes at 80 ms froze the UI for 320 ms, which threw the timing of the following chord off as well). They are now onsets the engine schedules against, so they cost nothing and land exactly.
+ Playback no longer needs a record-armed track: the engine sits at the top of the normal track FX chain instead of the Input FX chain. Notes played this way are heard but not recorded - use INSERT to write the progression into an item.
+ Starting mid-bar or scrubbing the transport now lands on the chord that belongs at that position instead of restarting the progression.
+ PLAY shows the playback mode in its colour: blue for Sync Play, green for Tight Timing, teal for both, and orange when Tight Timing is on but the engine is not actually running (no track selected, FX bypassed or missing).
+ The engine is written into REAPER/Effects on demand and version-locked to the script, so it can never lag behind the data the script writes. With the option off, or no track selected, playback falls back to the previous timing rather than going silent.

[Progression / Chord Length]
+ New default length for new chords (Right-Click the beats column of the [+] slot panel): 0.5 / 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 beats. Previously every new chord was one beat, so working in bars meant stepping the value up in every single slot by hand. The setting is stored globally, so it survives project and script restarts. Requested by a user who wanted whole-bar or two-bar chords.
+ Same menu: "Use This Slot's Length As Default" and "Apply Default Length To All Slots".
+ Chord map templates use the default length as well. Saved presets keep the lengths stored in the file.

[MIDI / Stuck Notes]
+ Bug fix - notes could be left sounding with no note-off ever following, which a retrospective recording then stretches to the end of the item. stopNotesFromPlaying was driven by the list of the last chord played, so a second chord starting while a first was still sounding orphaned any note that appeared only in the earlier one. It now releases everything that is actually sounding. Reachable through overlapping MIDI triggers and through Hold Mode. Reported by Deodan.
+ Bug fix - closing the ChordGun window while a chord was sounding left those notes hanging permanently, with no key or button able to rescue them. The window now kills all playing notes on the way out.

[MIDI Trigger]
+ Bug fix - the "Assign MIDI Trigger" overlay sent you to the top bar to switch the connector icon on. That icon is not in the top bar: it sits in the small column at the right of the chord display, between the dice and the pin. The overlay now says where it actually is. Reported by Deodan.

[Menus]
+ The Dice right-click menu holds randomize settings only (Progression Length, Always Start on Tonic, Use Selected Chord Types). Playback settings live on PLAY, chord length on the [+] panel. Tooltips now name what a menu contains instead of saying "Settings".

2.5.6

[Time Selection / Insert]
+ Bug fix — when Note Length is set to "Time Selection" but no time selection is active, the length now correctly falls back to the MIDI Editor grid. Previously the -1 sentinel leaked into the grid calculation, producing tiny notes and a cursor that jumped back one beat.

[Note Length / Grid]
+ Bug fix — "Grid" note length now uses the project/arrange grid when no MIDI editor is open (was: defaulted to 1/32, or even a zero-length/invisible note on the very first insert, until an item had been opened in the MIDI editor at least once). The grid length now always falls back to a valid value, so notes are never zero-length.
+ "Grid" note length now follows the MIDI Editor grid only when the editor is actually visible. A docked MIDI Editor in a closed/hidden docker no longer counts as "open" (it kept a valid pointer), so the length correctly falls back to the arrange grid instead of a leftover editor grid (e.g. 1/32). Requires js_ReaScriptAPI for visibility detection.

[Inversion]
+ Simplified the inversion system to a single source of truth: Ctrl+Click on a chord button now cycles the global inversion for that scale degree (root → 1st → 2nd → ... → root, based on the actual number of chord notes) and previews it. The "Inv:" value box in the top frame always reflects the current value.
+ Click (preview), Shift+Click (insert) and Alt+Click (add to slot) now all respect the selected inversion automatically — re-previewing is just another Click, no special modifier needed.
+ Drag & drop onto a progression slot now also carries the selected inversion (was: always inserted the root-position chord).
+ Removed the separate temporary cycle system: no more 2-second reset timer, no more "I1/I2/I3" badge, and Ctrl+Shift+Click / Ctrl+Alt+Click are no longer needed (they now behave like Shift+Click / Alt+Click). This fixes the preview/badge mismatch and the inability to re-preview an inversion.

[MIDI Trigger]
+ Bug fix — "Clear All Mappings" in the MIDI Trigger menu did nothing when no ChordMap presets were saved. The greyed-out "(no presets)" placeholder still consumed a menu index, so the Clear action ended up on the wrong index. The index is now calculated from the actual number of delete-menu items, so Clear All Mappings works with or without saved presets.

[MIDI Playback / Recording]
+ Bug fix — note-off messages from button clicks now always use the same MIDI channel as the matching note-on. Previously the channel was re-read at note-off time, so if it changed in between (MIDI editor opening/closing, or toggling Scale Filter / MIDI Trigger) the note-off landed on a different channel and the note was never released. This caused stuck notes that, with retroactive MIDI recording, were stretched all the way to the end of the item. stopAllNotesFromPlaying now also clears every channel that was actually used.

[MIDI Trigger / Learn]
+ The "Assign MIDI Trigger" / "Assign Column Trigger" flow now uses a non-blocking on-screen overlay instead of a modal pop-up. While listening you see a centered prompt; the moment a MIDI note arrives it is mapped, a short "Assigned: <note>" confirmation is shown, and the overlay closes automatically — no more clicking OK and no more wondering whether it worked.
+ Assigning a trigger now also works while MIDI Trigger is globally OFF. The overlay shows a reminder that you still have to enable the connector icon (top bar) for triggers to actually fire, since it is off by default and the icon is not obvious.
+ The MIDI Trigger icon now pulses with an extra ring while you are assigning a trigger, making it clear the script is waiting for a note.
+ Press Esc or click anywhere to cancel an assignment in progress.

2.5.5

[Strum]
+ Bug fix — strum offset is now correctly applied when inserting via Shift+Click (PPQ-per-beat was mis-calculated)
+ Tempo-independent — strum delay (ms) now scales with project BPM so the feel stays consistent across tempos
+ Combined right-click popup menu with submenus and check-marks (Speed Mode, Delay ms presets + Custom, Grid 1/8-1/64, Velocity Curve off/up/down/v/^, Ramp Amount presets + Custom) — no separate Ctrl modifier
+ Velocity ramp curves applied to both inserted notes and live preview playback (scale chord, slot, progression incl. repeats and next-slot)

[Velocity]
+ Default Velocity: New global velocity setting via "Vel:" button in top frame next to Oct:/Inv:. Left-click cycles presets, right-click opens menu (Follow MIDI Editor / 16 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 80 / 96 / 112 / 127 / Custom). Persists between sessions.
+ Per-Slot Velocity: New "V" button on the left side of each progression slot opens a velocity panel with a theme-styled slider (1-127) overriding the global Vel: for that slot. Click "x" to reset to follow global. Persists with progression presets.

[Time Selection / Insert]
+ Cursor now snaps to start of time selection if it lies outside, so Shift+Click always inserts at the selection start
+ When no time selection is active, length now falls back to MIDI Editor grid (was: very short / 2 sec on new items)
+ New MIDI items are now created at the start of the time selection (was: created from the edit cursor, which placed notes outside or in the middle of the new item)
+ New item length now exactly matches the time selection (1-bar minimum no longer applied in this mode)
+ Newly created MIDI items are now always at least 1 bar (was: 1/2 was too short, shorter lengths jumped to 1 bar inconsistently)
+ Edit cursor only wraps back to time-selection start when Note Length is set to "Time Selection". With fixed note lengths the cursor now keeps moving forward through the item even if a time selection happens to be active.

[Chord Recognition]
+ Added recognition for 6, m6, add9, madd9, 9, 6/9, 11, min11, maj11, 13, min13, maj13
+ Fixed maj13 / 13 patterns to omit the (avoid-note) 11th — Cmaj13 played as C E G B D A is now correctly recognized as Cmaj13 instead of C6
+ Scoring now favors longer/exact patterns so e.g. Cmaj7 no longer mis-recognizes as C6 when both have the same number of matched notes
+ Partial-match recognition: notes may now be omitted from a voicing (1 missing for 4-note chords, 2 for 5+ note chords) — e.g. Cmaj13 without the 9 is still recognized as Cmaj13 instead of Am9/C
+ Core-interval check ensures root, 3rd and 7th are present before scoring — prevents nonsense matches on partial voicings
+ Recognition patterns are now derived from the central chord data table (single source of truth) — no more drift between insert and recognize
+ Fixed Dm9 / C9 / G9 etc. inserting as plain min7 / dom7 — chord data patterns were missing the 9
+ Fixed 11, min11, 13, maj13, min13, maj#11 chord data patterns that were missing the 9 (and 11 in min13)
+ Added madd9 and maj11 to the chord data table (were only in the recognizer before)

[Monitor]
+ Chord/Note display now shows the current octave of the played note(s) as an "Oct: N" indicator centered directly below the chord/note name in the monitor window — useful for live monitoring with controllers like the Launchpad. The octave reflects the lowest currently-held note.

[Inversion]
+ Ctrl+Click on chord button cycles inversion (root → 1st → 2nd → 3rd → root) with visual badge "I1/I2/I3" in top-right corner. Cycle resets after 2 seconds of no Ctrl+Click on the same button.
+ Ctrl+Shift+Click inserts the chord using the current cycle inversion (does NOT advance the cycle, so the badge value is what gets inserted)
+ Ctrl+Alt+Click adds the chord to the selected progression slot using the current cycle inversion (does NOT advance the cycle)

[Tooltips]
+ Tooltips now support multi-line text and are clamped within the window so they no longer extend off-screen
+ Chord-button tooltip rewritten as multi-line list of all click actions

[UI]
+ Note Length dropdown now has visible "Note length" label and is wider so "Time selection" fits
+ Chord Style dropdown widened so all entries are readable
+ Inversion moved to top frame next to Octave (compact "Inv:" / "Oct:" labels) to free space on the chord-name row
+ Chord-name display right-aligned and uses full available width to the right of the dropdowns
+ Top button row shifted slightly left for tighter alignment
+ Removed redundant "Scale:" label from top frame to free space for the new Velocity button

[Drag & Drop]
+ Chord buttons can now be dragged onto progression slots (alternative to Alt+Click). A ghost label follows the cursor and the target slot highlights while dragging.

[Persistence]
+ "Always on Top" and "Tooltips" toggles are now remembered between sessions (saved globally)
+ Preset Loading: Out-of-range scale/chord indices in old preset files are clamped to valid values

[Crash Fixes]
+ Sparse table.concat crash when switching scales (e.g. Pentatonic > Blues) — ProjExtState tables are now self-healing
+ "MediaItem_Take expected" after deleting an item and using Shift+Click — take pointers now validated via ValidatePtr + GetMediaItemTake_Item + TakeIsMIDI
+ Shift+Click insert no longer fails with "attempt to index nil" — `playOrInsertScaleChord` now correctly resolves the selected scale note and chord type before use

[State Management]
+ Chord button highlight no longer stays "stuck" on the slot-chord after Ctrl+Alt+Click → slot select → chord click — `currentlyPlayingChord` is now cleared on every chord-button press
+ New central `resetTransientState()` clears playback overlays (currentlyPlayingChord, slot velocity override, voice-leading reference, drag state, inversion cycle) on stop, slot remove, scale change and progression clear — prevents stale state from leaking between actions

2.5.1

TRIBUTE & ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
================================================================================

This script is based on the brilliant "ChordGun" by pandabot.

A huge thank you to pandabot for creating the original ChordGun - an incredibly
intuitive and creative MIDI chord generator. 
The core design, scale-based chord generation, and keyboard
shortcuts are all testament to pandabot's vision for making music theory accessible
and fun within REAPER.

TK modifications build upon this solid foundation by adding:
- Scale filtering and remapping for live MIDI performance
- Real-time chord recognition and analysis
- Enhanced progression workflow tools
- Improved UI flexibility and cross-platform support

The original ChordGun remains at the heart of this tool. All credit for the core
concept and brilliant UX design goes to pandabot.

Thank you, pandabot, for this amazing contribution to the REAPER community!

-- === Sequencer engine bridge ================================================
--
-- Progression playback normally runs from the defer loop, which decides when a
-- chord starts with about 33 ms of slack and then hands it to StuffMIDIMessage,
-- where it waits for the start of the next audio block. Together that is far
-- too loose to play against a grid. The JSFX engine takes the timing over: Lua
-- writes the whole progression into gmem and the audio thread emits the notes
-- on the exact sample.
--
-- Lua keeps every musical decision. A slot crosses over as a list of notes that
-- each carry their own velocity, onset and gate, so strum, arpeggios, velocity
-- curves and inversions are still produced by the code below -- the engine only
-- places what it is given.
