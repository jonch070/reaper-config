WV PLAYER

Play all your Multimedia files... can play any multimedia files, from
sound to movies, WAV, MIDI, MPG, AVI, MP3, ... in fact anything you
want, provided you have all the necessary filters and codecs available
in your computer.

This used to be named WavPlayer, so it really is the same program and
not a diferent one. But the name was a little misleading, as it didn't
stop at wav files only. It was called WavPlayer, just because it started
it's life as a simple WAV player... 
Then, it naturally evolved to a full multimedia player.

Can play videos zoomed and full screen, show frame rate and play in 
slow motion (not all, just some..), save AVI individual frames as JPG 
to disk, etc...

Also has a special 'kiosk mode' that shows the interface centered in
the middle of the screen, with no caption and a few menus disabled, 
for a few special uses.

Works with multiple soundcards for playing WAV files, if you are
lucky to have more than one (soundcard) installed - or want to send
different 'voice' commands to different sound interfaces. This works
even from the command line.

Has a full 'Play List' to which you may add any files you want, and
let it play all unatended, amoung a few other goodies. :-)

Allows multiselect of files to play directly from the file browser
too, as well as 'select all'.


Can also work only from the command line, using a string like:
"{path_to_program}\wv_player.exe" /n:x {path_to_file}\sound.wav"
to play only the files and auto exit.

To make it clearer, here is a command line example:
* you have player (wv_player.exe) in folder  C:\Programs\utils 
* you have a file to play (sound.wav) in folder  C:\win\sounds\
 
so, command line, with above example, should go like this:
 "C:\Programs\utils\wv_player.exe C:\win\sounds\sound.wav"
 
And if you want to repeat the playing, there is an extra option; 
so if you want the sound to play twice:
 "C:\Programs\utils\wv_player.exe /n:2 C:\win\sounds\sound.wav"

And if you want to play (wav file) it on a different soundcard - lucky you;)
there is another option; so to play it twice on your second card:
 "C:\Programs\utils\wv_player.exe /n:2 /c:1 C:\win\sounds\sound.wav"

The /n: switch is the number of times the command line will repeat 
playback, and must be right after the program's name, before the
filenames to play. Note: to stop the playback in command line mode, 
just use the combination    Ctrl+Break   keys.

The /c: switch is the soundcard's number you want to play on.
Just note that 1st soundcard is numbered 'zero' (0). second is
numbered 'one' (1), etc... Note: multi-soundcards only work for WAV
files :(


Ah, and don't forget that command lines that have spaces in it are
required by Windows itself to be between "". So, an example with spaces
in the path name could be like this:
 "C:\Documents and Settings\wv_player.exe" "C:\Documents and Settings\wav\Missing.wav"
note: both parts of the command line are between "" as both have
spaces in it...
 
--------------------------
Install / Uninstall

Never liked programs that install files all over the hard disk;
To install this program, you only have to copy the files to a
suitable directory, and then run it from there.

To uninstall, you only have to delete the directory you created and
the files within, and... that's all !
