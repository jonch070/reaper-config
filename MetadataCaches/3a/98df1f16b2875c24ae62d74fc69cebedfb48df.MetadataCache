D d `Here's the basic thinking for this preliminary version:    Since your workflow involves "marking" tracks as "to orchestrate," "MIDI to be replaced," and "finished stems" via moving tracks to one of those folders, I think it makes sense to decouple folders from signal flow. This way, the template can be "pre-routed," but you can still move tracks without affecting what is routed where. Feel free to check out the Routing Matrix, but the basic overview of the signal flow is this:    There are 4 "parents:" Orchestra, Rhythm Section, Synths, and Effects all output to Music Sub Mix. Within those, "children" output to their "parents" as you'd expect, but rather than implicitly routing via the folder hierarchy, tracks are explicitly routed. Meaning, for example, Flute 1 and Flute 2 (in this case representing, say, Kontakt instruments) ouput to Flutes, which ouputs to Woodwinds, which outputs to Orchestra, which outputs to Music Sub Mix.    Similarly, tracks such as DX, FX, and Temp MX output to Movie.     Movie, Movie Sub Mix, and Click go to the master/main output.    It's worth noting that, so that new tracks' output signal aren't accidentally doubled, Preferences -> Project -> Track/Send Defaults -> Main (parent) send should be unchecked.`
